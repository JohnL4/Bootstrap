    <p><strong>Time for a declaration:</strong></p>

    <p>
      When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people
      to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another,
      and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal
      station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a
      decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should
      declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
    </p>

    <p class="pull-left">
      This seems to be the first paragraph, according to Wikipedia? Surely
      not.
    </p>

    <p class="pull-right">
      Well, the following paragraphs really do seem to be the
      entire <em>second</em> paragraph.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
      that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that
      among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
    </p>

    <p>
      That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,
      deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That
      whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is
      the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new
      government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing
      its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
      Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments
      long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and
      accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to
      suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by
      abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train
      of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a
      design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is the right, it is
      the duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their
      future security.
    </p>

    <p class="pull-right">
      ...and it goes on.
